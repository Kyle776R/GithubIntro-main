# GitHub Intro

This repository is for an in-class activity to introduce you to GitHub pull
requests. You will add your name to the list of names in the file
`contributors.md`.

## GitHub Workflow

When contributing to a project on GitHub that has multiple developers,
generally one does not push changes directly to the main repository. Instead,
each developer creates a *fork* of the repository, pushes their changes to
their fork, and then requests that those changes be merged into the main
repository via a *pull request*.

Fork this repository by clicking the "Fork" button in the upper left corner of
this page on GitHub. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub
account. Generally you only do this step once for any given repository that you
want to contribute to.

Now you can clone your fork to your computer. This works just like cloning from
git-keeper, but here you get the clone URL from GitHub. In your fork (make sure
you are in your fork and not the original repository!) click the green "Clone
or download" button. Copy the URL, and then clone the repository as you would a
git-keeper assignment.

In your local clone, add your name to the file `contributors.md`, commit your
changes, and push. Now go back to your fork on GitHub and you should see a
message that you have pushed to your fork, and a "Compare & pull request"
button. Click on this button, make sure everything looks good, and click on
“Create pull request”.

Now I will be able to merge your changes into the main repository.
